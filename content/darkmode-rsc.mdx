## Tale of Tailwind

I joined the [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) hype train and couldn't have been happier with the choice.

At [Xealth](https://xealth.io/), we recently adopted Tailwind CSS as the primary way to implement our software designs. 
For those who don't know what Tailwind is, you can find out more [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

I currently lead the Tools team at Xealth. Here's a TLDR of what we do:
We build cool stuff to help our 
employees and customers 
be more productive.

In tandem with adopting Tailwind, we also adopted [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the framework for building new tools.

We wanted to (finally) give our users the ability to toggle between light and dark mode. This article will walk you through how we tackled this seemingly simple idea 
and will hopefully get your creative juices flowing!


## React Server Components

We'll be using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the framework example, but these concepts generally apply to any React Server Component app, like [Gatsby's Partial Hydration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/partial-hydration/).

React Server Components introduce a new mental model for thinking about *how* to build React apps. If you want an excellent guide on RSCs, check out [this](https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components) article.

Adding Tailwind dark to a *purely client side React app* is pretty straightforward. You simply create a Vite app, follow [this](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), and follow Tailwind's [Dark Mode guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

However, adding Tailwind to a React Server Component app is a bit more tricky.

*But why?*

## The Problem
If you want to take advantage of Tailwind's [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) feature, you have two options:
- You can use the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media query
  - This changes the color scheme based on the user's OS settings
- You can [toggle dark mode manually](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) with the `class` strategy
  - This changes the color scheme based on the user's preference

In many cases, you'll want the user to be able to toggle between light and dark mode; That's where the `class` strategy comes in handy.

This issue is that the `class` strategy requires *dynamic* CSS. 

### Dynamic CSS in React

Dynamic css isn't a problem for client-side apps because the JSX is rendered on the client, and the CSS is also applied on the client.

What's an example of dynamic css? Let's take [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) for example:

```typescript
import clsx from 'clsx';

export default function App () {
  const shouldBeBigText = true;
  const className = clsx('text-white', {
    'text-lg': shouldBeBigText,
  });

  return (
    <div className={className}>
      Hello World
    </div>
  );
}
```
```txt
clsx is a tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.
```

If you wanted to create a simple toggle button that toggles between light and dark mode, you'd do something like this:

```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';

export default function App () {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);
  const className = clsx({
    'dark': isDarkMode,
  });

  return (
    <div className={className}>
    {/** ‚òùÔ∏è add dark to the root of the app */}
      <button onClick={() => setIsDarkMode(!isDarkMode)}>
        Toggle Dark Mode
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
Now, imagine what would happen if you tried to do this in a React Server Component Framework (like Next).

The flow would look something like this:
```txt
1. HTTP Request to the Next server
2. Next server renders the component
3. User presses the toggle button
4. The color of the app changes
```
This is fine, right? 

<Image
  alt={'Some meme'}
  src={'https://media.michaelangrivera.com/michaelangeloio/wrong-not.gif'}
  width={300}
  height={100}
/>

When the user refreshes the page, the apps's theme will revert back to the default color. What the heck!

## The Tailwind Flash

Ok, what if you stored the user's preference in the React state or [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API?

That code might look something like this:
```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';

export default function App () {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);
  const className = clsx({
    'dark': isDarkMode,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const isDarkMode = localStorage.getItem('isDarkMode');
    setIsDarkMode(isDarkMode);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={className}>
    {/** ‚òùÔ∏è add dark to the root of the app */}
      <button onClick={() => setIsDarkMode(!isDarkMode)}>
        Toggle Dark Mode
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The app flow, however, would look something like this:
```txt
1. HTTP Request to the Next server
2. Next server renders the component
3. User presses the toggle button and the preference is saved
4. The color of the app changes
5. User refreshes the page
6. FLASH! The color of the app starts off light and then changes to dark
```

The flash happens because the *default* (light mode) CSS is rendered on the server, and the user's preference is stored on the client. That preference is applied once the client renders the component.

In Nextjs 12, users had to resort to (disputable) hacks like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71277655/prevent-page-flash-in-next-js-12-with-tailwind-css-class-based-dark-mode). 

Popular packages like [`next-themes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) also [haven't been updated](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes/issues/152) to support Next 13 (as of writing this article). 

<Image
  alt={'Some meme'}
  src={'https://media.michaelangrivera.com/michaelangeloio/05onfire1_xp-superJumbo-v2.jpeg'}
  width={300}
  height={100}
/>

So, what's the solution?

## The Secret Sauce

Let's backtrack and approach the problem from a thousand foot view. 

### Understanding the Request flow
<div className="flex justify-center items-center ">
<Image
  alt={'Request Flow Diagram'}
  src={'https://media.michaelangrivera.com/michaelangeloio/renderingstrategy.png'}
  width={300}
  height={100}
/>
</div>

RSCs are rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client. This concept means that the HTML (and by default the CSS) is rendered on the *server*. It isn't obvious to think about at first. 
The CSS is still rendered on the client, but if you have any *dynamic* CSS in an RSC, the resulting CSS is a product of the server rendering the component.

For Nextjs specifically, refer to the diagram above. We must ensure that the CSS is rendered on the server with the correct class at the Layout level. 
This configuration allows for Tailwind to be rendered on initial hydration with the correct class (namely, the `dark` class) and be applied **globally**.

### Enter Cookies üç™

The solution is to employ a user preference state that is preserved on the client and sent on **every request**. 

Cookies are right up this alley. The user's preference is stored in a cookie, and the server reads this cookie when running `layout.ts`. The server can now render the component with the correct CSS.

Let's walk through an example of how we implemented this at Xealth.

### Step 1: Configure Tailwind to use the `class` strategy

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  // ...
}
```
<a className='text-xs' target="_blank" href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually'>view source</a>

### Step 2: Create a client component

We'll create a component that toggles between light and dark mode. This component will set a client-side cookie, and then refresh the page.

```tsx
// ThemeSelector.tsx
'use client'
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
const ThemeSelector = ({ theme }: { theme: 'light' | 'dark' }) => {
  const router = useRouter()
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          Cookies.set('x-theme', theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')
          router.refresh()
        }}
        aria-label="switch theme"
        className="rounded bg-indigo-600 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold
         text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-indigo-500 focus-visible:outline 
         focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 
         focus-visible:outline-indigo-600"
      >
     { theme === 'dark' ? 'Light Mode' : 'Dark Mode' }
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
export default ThemeSelector
```

In this code we're using the popular [`js-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie) package to set the cookie. 
We're also using Next's [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) hook to refresh the page.

Calling `router.refresh()` will refresh the page is a **key component** here, because it will send the cookie on the next request.

### Step 3: Use Cookies in the root `Layout.ts` component

```tsx
// Layout.tsx
import clsx from 'clsx'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import SomeHeader from './components/Header'
import './globals.css'
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Some App',
  description: 'Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down',
}
export default async function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const prefersDark = cookies().get('x-theme')?.value === 'dark'
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={clsx("your main classes here", prefersDark ? 'dark' : undefined)}>
        {/** ‚òùÔ∏è add dark to the root of the app based on the cookie*/}
        <SomeHeader />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Step 4: If Nextjs, Make the Theme Select Component Dynamic

If you're using Nextjs and want to import this `ThemeSelector.tsx` component in a RSC, you'll need to make the client component dynamic.

We'll need this because Nextjs by default renders components (even client components) as [Static by default](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default). 
Setting the component to dynamic also allows you to **avoid** making the `Layout.tsx` component a client component (if your Header component is a server component, for example). 

```tsx
//SomeHeader.tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
const ThemeSelector = dynamic(() => import('./ThemeSelector'), {
  ssr: false,
})
const Header = ({ user }: { user?: z.infer<typeof userSchema> }) => {
  const theme = cookies().get('x-theme')?.value
  return (
    <nav className="border-b border-gray-200 bg-white shadow-md dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-800">
      <ThemeSelector theme={theme === 'dark' ? 'dark' : 'light'} />
    </nav>
  )
}
export default Header
```

### Step 5: Your eyes Profit üí∏

And that's it! You should now have a working dark mode toggle that persists on refresh. 
It'll even persist if the user closes the browser and opens it again.

## Additional Resources

This concept can be applied (generally) to any React Server Component framework that follows the same request flow as Nextjs. [Gatsby's Partial Hydration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/partial-hydration/) has a similar model. 
At the time of writing this, one would need to figure out how to obtain the request's cookies on the Gatsby server side.

If you need a live example, you can also find the source code used on my [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelangelo-io/michaelangelo.io) by searching `ThemeSelector.tsx` and `Layout.tsx`. 

This article should give you some ideas on utilizing Next 13's powerful extensibility in building cool features like Dark Mode! More importantly, I hope your eyes thank you.
