summary: "How to add SSE to your Node/Bun/Edge servers (like Nextjs)"
---

At [Xealth](https://www.xealth.com/), I was tasked with building an application that monitors real-time status data from [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) as these workflows 
provisions test patients in a simulated environment. Rather than polling the API, we leveraged [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) to receive real-time updates.
I was surprised that there weren't many examples of implementing SSE!

I needed to share what I learned after building this feature *again* with [ActivityStreak](https://activitystreak.app/). 

This article is about how to add [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) to your app
so that you can leverage "real-time" updates via the standard [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) API.

> I was heavily inspired by [This Article](https://medium.com/@ruslanfg/long-running-nextjs-requests-eff158e75c1d), this Nextjs [Issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/48427), and [`node-ssestream`](https://github.com/EventSource/node-ssestream).

## Option 1: You can check out my small lib called `ts-sse`

If you're looking to quickly add [Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) to your app, I've created a little package called [`ts-sse`](https://github.com/michaelangeloio/ts-sse). 
For in-depth details on how to use it, please see the [README](https://github.com/michaelangeloio/ts-sse/blob/main/README.md).

Installing the package isn't necessary; You can copy the code from the [source](https://github.com/michaelangeloio/ts-sse/blob/main/src/writer.ts)! 

## Option 2: You can build it yourself!

> Note: This article uses [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), but you can use this approach with any Node/Bun/Edge compatible server.

### Step 1: Determine your runtime environment 🤔

Code is hard, but choosing the right Javascript implementation is harder. Knowing your runtime environment is arguably the most critical step! Why? Just take a look below 😅

Let's assume you're using Node and Nextjs, for instance. The new Nextjs App Dir utilizes the standard Web APIs [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
Because these APIs aren't the classic Node [Request/Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequestoptions-callback) APIs, the implementation of Server-Sent Events
is quite different.

#### To sum up:

- If your route handler accepts the Web API Standard [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), you'll likely want to use the Nodejs [Web Streams API](https://nodejs.org/api/webstreams.html) (now available in `nodejs>=18`). Think Nextjs, Bun. 

- If your route handler accepts the classic Node Node [Request/Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequestoptions-callback) APIs, I recommend tailoring your code similar to [`node-ssestream`](https://github.com/EventSource/node-ssestream/tree/master). [Nestjs's implementation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/server-sent-events) also uses this approach. Think classic Express, Fastify, etc.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Server-Sent Events Protocol 📜

Even though SSE seems complex at first, it's as simple as the diagram above.
The [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) protocol is a protocol that allows the server to send events to the client. The client can listen to these events via the [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) API. 


This article focuses on the server-side implementation of this protocol. I *highly suggest* reading the main [SSE HTML Spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) to understand the protocol's nuances. 

> Overall, you need to know that the EventSource API expects an HTTP stream of **structured UTF-8 encoded text data**. 

The data you send to the client typically looks like this:
  
- **Basic Message:** 

```txt
data: Hello, world!
```

- **Multiple Events:** 

```txt

data: This is the first message. 
   
data: {"message": "some JSON"}
```

- **Named Events:** 

```txt

event: user-login
data: {"username": "john_doe", "time": "10:15 AM"}
  
event: user-logout
data: {"username": "john_doe", "time": "10:45 AM"}
```

- **Setting an ID for an Event and Retry:** 

```txt

id: 12345
data: This message has an ID.
retry: 5000
```

That's it! It's just a stream of text. As the client `EventSource` receives this text stream and data, it parses the data and emits the appropriate events for you.

### Step 3: Create an SSE Writer 📝

Now that you understand the protocol, you can create a text writer that emits the correct data.

> Note: Most of the remaining steps should have parity with the classic Node Stream API as long as you're calling [`writeable.write`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#writablewritechunk-encoding-callback) or [`response.write`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-response-write-method/#) with the correct data.

In `ts-sse`, I have the following code that writes a string to a stream:
  
```ts
writeMessage(
  writer: WritableStreamDefaultWriter,
  encoder: TextEncoder,
  message: Message
): void {
  if (message.comment) {
    void writer.write(encoder.encode(`: ${message.comment}\n`))
  }
  if (message.event) {
    void writer.write(encoder.encode(`event: ${message.event}\n`))
  }
  if (message.id) {
    void writer.write(encoder.encode(`id: ${message.id}\n`))
  }
  if (message.retry) {
    void writer.write(encoder.encode(`retry: ${message.retry}\n`))
  }
  if (message.data) {
    void writer.write(encoder.encode(toDataString(message.data)))
  }
}
```

You can make this a standalone function or part of a class. Don't worry about the `encoder` and `writer` for now. You mainly need to understand that we write to the stream with the appropriate newlines and prefixes.

`toDataString` looks like this:

```ts

export function toDataString(data: string | Record<string, unknown>): string {
  if (isObject(data)) {
    return toDataString(JSON.stringify(data))
  }

  return data
    .split(/\r\n|\r|\n/)
    .map((line) => `data: ${line}\n\n`)
    .join('')
}
```
<a className='text-xs' target="_blank" href='https://github.com/michaelangeloio/ts-sse/blob/main/src/utils.ts'>view source</a>
> Notice how we add the `data:` prefix to each line with a **double newline**. This is important! Double newlines are how the `EventSource` API knows when to emit an event on the client.

`toDataString` lets us send a string or an object.

If you're wondering what the `message` object looks like, it's just a simple interface with a generic:

```ts
export interface Message<T = string | Record<string, unknown>> {
  data: T
  comment?: string
  event?: string
  id?: string
  retry?: number
}
```

The combined code above should be enough to get your text stream looking good. You can organize this code to your liking.

> This methodology applies to other backend languages like Go, Python, etc. Great article [here](https://thedevelopercafe.com/articles/server-sent-events-in-go-595ae2740c7a).

### Step 4: Create a SSE Stream 🤝

Remember how I talked about your runtime environment? Well, this is the secret sauce. Creating a Web API-compatible stream is different from creating a classic Node stream.

#### Web API Stream

Let's create a Web API-compatible stream. This stream is compatible with the Nextjs [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.

As long as you have `TransformStream` available to you (which is available in `nodejs>=18` and [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/api/streams)), you can create a stream like this:

```ts
// app/api/stream/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET() {
  const stream = new TransformStream()
  const writer = stream.writable.getWriter()
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  ... // write your SSE messages here
  return new NextResponse(stream.readable, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    Connection: 'keep-alive',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
  },
})
}
```

Breaking this down, you can see `TransformStream` gives us both a reader and a writer. We will use the writer to write our SSE messages and return the reader to the client.


#### Classic Node Stream

Here's how the same thing would look like with the classic Node [Request/Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequestoptions-callback) APIs, like Express:

```js
// some-express-app.js
app.get('/streaming', (req, res) => {

    res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');
    res.flushHeaders(); // flush the headers to establish SSE with client

    ... // write your SSE messages here
    res.write(message); // res.write() instead of res.send()

    // If client closes connection, stop sending events
    res.on('close', () => {
        console.log('client dropped me');
        res.end();
    });
});
```

By calling [`res.write`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-response-write-method), we are writing the SSE chunk to the stream (which defaults to utf8 encoding). 

If you're using Nestjs, check out their [SSE implementation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/server-sent-events) for a more robust example.


### Step 5: Write your SSE Messages 📨

Now that you have a stream, you can write your SSE messages.

Here is sample code with the `WriteMessage` function we just made:

```ts
// app/api/stream/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET() {
  const stream = new TransformStream()
  const writer = stream.writable.getWriter()
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()

  writeMessage(
    writer,
    encoder,
    {
      data: 'Hello, world!',
    }
  )

  return new NextResponse(stream.readable, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    Connection: 'keep-alive',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
  },
})
}
```
### Step 6: Let's make the writer type safe ⭐

If you're like me, you probably think, "This is great, but I want to make this type-safe!".

Let's make the writer type-safe by creating a generic `SSEWriter` class. This class will essentially be a wrapper around the `writeMessage` function we made earlier.

Most importantly, it will ensure that the `data` property of the `Message` interface is correct by implementing an `EventNotifier` interface:

```ts
// app/api/stream/writer.ts
export class Writer implements EventNotifier {
  constructor(
    readonly writer: WritableStreamDefaultWriter,
    readonly encoder: TextEncoder
  ) {}

  writeMessage(){
    ...//same code as before
  }

  update(message: Message) {
    this.writeMessage(this.writer, this.encoder, message)
  }

  complete(message: Message) {
    this.writeMessage(this.writer, this.encoder, message)
    void this.writer.close()
  }
}

// 👇 a factory function to create the class above
export const getSSEWriter = (
  writer: WritableStreamDefaultWriter,
  encoder: TextEncoder
) => new Writer(writer, encoder)
```

Add a corresponding `EventNotifier` interface:

```ts
// app/api/stream/writer.ts
export interface Message<T = string | Record<string, unknown>> {
  data: T
  comment?: string
  event?: string
  id?: string
  retry?: number
}

export interface EventNotifier<
  T extends {
    update: T['update'] extends Message ? Message<T['update']>['data'] : never
    complete: T['complete'] extends Message
      ? Message<T['complete']>['data']
      : never
  } = any
> {
  update: (
    message: Message<T['update']>['data'],
  ) => void
  complete: (
    message: Message<T['complete']>['data'],
  ) => void
}
```

As you can see, we can now ensure the passed type is correct by supplying a type to the `EventNotifier` interface generic.

We have a little of that Typescript magic now ✨. 

What might an example look like? Let's say we have a `RickEvents` type:

```ts
type RickEvents = EventNotifier<{
  update: {
    data: {
      neverGonna: string
      giveYouUp: string
    },
    event: 'some-event'
  }
  complete: {
    data: {
      neverGonna: string
      letYouDown: string
    },
    event: 'some-event'
  }
}>

```

We can now ensure that the `update` and `complete` methods only accept the correct data. These 
methods write the valid SSE message to the stream. 

Piecing it all together, we can now write type-safe SSE messages:

```ts
// app/api/stream/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getSSEWriter } from './writer'


export async function GET() {
  const stream = new TransformStream()
  const writer = stream.writable.getWriter()
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()

  const sseWriter = getSSEWriter(writer, encoder)

  const rickEventsStream = async (notifier: RicketEvents) => {
    notifier.update({
      data: {
        neverGonna: 'give you up',
        giveYouUp: 'never gonna',
      },
      event: 'some-event',
    })
    // 👈 do some async stuff here
    notifier.complete({
      data: {
        neverGonna: 'let you down',
        letYouDown: 'never gonna',
      },
      event: 'some-event',
    })
  }

  rickEventsStream(sseWriter)

  return new NextResponse(stream.readable, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    Connection: 'keep-alive',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-transform',
  },
})
}
```

And this is exactly what `ts-sse` does! Understanding these concepts allows for a more flexible and robust SSE implementation.

We can even pass a zod schema (if you fancy `zod`) to the `EventNotifier` interface:

```ts
// app/api/stream/route.ts
type RickEvents = EventNotifier<{
  update: {
    data: z.infer<typeof rickRollSchema>
    event: 'some-event'
  }
  ...
}>

```

### Step 7: Use SSE on the client with `EventSource` 📡

Now that we have a stream, we can use the `EventSource` API to listen to the stream. 

This example uses React, but you can use any framework or even vanilla JS (if you're bold enough).


```tsx
'use client'
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { z } from "zod"
import { rickAstleySchema } from "./stream/types"

export const StreamClient = () => {
  const [lyric, setLyric] = useState<string>("")
  const source = new EventSource("/api/stream") // 👈 the route we made earlier 
                 // 👆 EventSource supports relative paths
  // 👇 listen to the event
  useEffect(() => {
    source.addEventListener('some-event', (event) => {
      const parsed = rickAstleySchema.safeParse(event.data)
      if (parsed.success) {
        setLyric(parsed.data)
      }
    })
  }, [])
  return lyric
}

```
Because we're importing the `rickAstleySchema` from the server code, we get the same type safety on the client!

> Note: if you're using Nextjs and wish to share types, make sure they are in a separate file or imported via `import type { myType }`.

There are plenty of more `EventSource` examples on [the web](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=eventsource+react+example). Let me know if you'd like me to write an EventSource article!
